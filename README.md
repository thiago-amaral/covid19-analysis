In this exploratory data analysis COVID-19 data was analysed, more specifically with regards to Australia.

It could be seen that Australia, and more broadly, Oceania dealt with the pandemic really well. 

It was also spotted that economic indicators did not correlate with deaths caused by COVID-19, which means the pandemic affected humanity as a whole!
